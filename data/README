The specification

1. The list is a set of rules, with one rule per line.
2. Each line is only read up to the first whitespace; entire lines can also be commented using //.
3. Each line which is not entirely whitespace or begins with a comment contains a rule.
4. Each rule lists a public suffix, with the subdomain portions separated by dots (.) as usual. A leading dot is optional.
5. The wildcard character * (asterisk) matches any valid sequence of characters in a hostname part. (Note: the list uses Unicode, not Punycode forms, and is encoded using UTF-8.)
6. Wildcards may only be used to wildcard an entire level. That is, they must be surrounded by dots (or implicit dots, at the beginning of a line).
7. If a hostname matches more than one rule in the file, the longest matching rule (the one with the most levels) will be used.
8. An exclamation mark (!) at the start of a rule marks an exception to a previous wildcard rule. An exception rule takes priority over any other matching rule.


Algorithm

1. Match domain against all rules and take note of the matching ones.
2. If no rules match, the prevailing rule is "*".
3. If more than one rule matches, the prevailing rule is the one which is an exception rule.
4. If there is no matching exception rule, the prevailing rule is the one with the most labels.
5. If the prevailing rule is a exception rule, modify it by removing the leftmost label.
6. The public suffix is the set of labels from the domain which directly match the labels of the prevailing rule (joined by dots).
7. The registered or registrable domain is the public suffix plus one additional label.
